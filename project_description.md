Project description

This project is a personal, doctor-led health evaluation service for people who want to understand how their body is functioning today.

It focuses on objective, measurable aspects of health across core biological systems such as cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory, neural, hormonal, and musculoskeletal function. Measurements are taken using simple tools, wearables, and finger-prick tests — many of which can be done at home, but are easier and more reliable when guided by a doctor.

The goal is understanding and orientation, not diagnosis or treatment.
Results are presented as system states, trends, and explanations of how different factors interact, along with general, non-medical recommendations that support stability and recovery.

The doctor remains central throughout: performing key measurements, reviewing results, interpreting patterns, and contextualizing findings. Software is used only to support consistency, structure, and clarity — not to automate medical decisions.

This service is for people who are curious about their health, want a clearer picture of how their systems are functioning, and value careful interpretation over quick answers.

High-level pipeline
	1.	Foundations
	•	Define health as system stability and recovery capacity
	•	Define core health systems and their roles
	2.	Measurement
	•	Collect objective metrics (home, wearable, finger-prick, in-person)
	•	Use standardized measurement protocols
	3.	Normalization
	•	Compare metrics to reference ranges and personal baselines
	•	Identify trends and variability
	4.	System mapping
	•	Group metrics by health system
	•	Assess each system’s current state (categorical, non-diagnostic)
	5.	Doctor review
	•	Validate data quality
	•	Add clinical context
	•	Adjust system interpretation if needed
	6.	Explanation
	•	Summarize key drivers per system
	•	Use simple causal explanations to show interactions and feedback loops
	7.	Recommendations
	•	Provide general, non-prescriptive guidance
	•	Focus on stability, recovery, and measurable follow-up
	8.	Output
	•	Deliver a clear written health overview
	•	Highlight current state, priorities, and next steps
